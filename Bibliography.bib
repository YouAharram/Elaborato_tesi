  abstract = {SAR and optical imagery provide highly complementary information about observed scenes. A combined use of these two modalities is thus desirable in many data fusion scenarios. However, any data fusion task requires measurements to be accurately aligned. While for both data sources images are usually provided in a georeferenced manner, the geo-localization of optical images is often inaccurate due to propagation of angular measurement errors. Many methods for the matching of homologous image regions exist for both SAR and optical imagery, however, these methods are unsuitable for SAR-optical image matching due to significant geometric and radiometric differences between the two modalities. In this paper, we present a three-step framework for sparse image matching of SAR and optical imagery, whereby each step is encoded by a deep neural network. We first predict regions in each image which are deemed most suitable for matching. A correspondence heatmap is then generated through a multi-scale, feature-space cross-correlation operator. Finally, outliers are removed by classifying the correspondence surface as a positive or negative match. Our experiments show that the proposed approach provides a substantial improvement over previous methods for SAR-optical image matching and can be used to register even large-scale scenes. This opens up the possibility of using both types of data jointly, for example for the improvement of the geo-localization of optical satellite imagery or multi-sensor stereogrammetry.}

  abstract = {An original method to denoise ultrasonic images affected by speckle is presented. Speckle is modeled as a signal-dependent noise corrupting the image. Noise reduction is approached as a Wiener-like filtering performed in a shift-invariant wavelet domain by means of an adaptive rescaling of the coefficients of an undecimated octave decomposition. The scaling factor of each coefficient is calculated from local statistics of the degraded image, the parameters of the noise model, and the wavelet filters. Experimental results demonstrate that excellent background smoothing as well as preservation of edge sharpness and fine details can be obtained.}
